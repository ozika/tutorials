#### Slides
- the slides are created from a markdown file using remarkjs
- to re-create them you need to pull the folder, go to the location in terminal and start a http server (type `python3 -m http.server`), and then open index.html. 

#### Code
- code comes with relatively little documentation, but the slides should provide guidance
